      <h1>This is a test to see what kind of page this will be once loaded into the browser</h1>
    </div>
    <p>What I plan to do with this page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I plan on taking elements from the initial template and fitting them together in this page to make it look nice</li>
      <li>I also plan on studying the template to see exactly how they do things and what kind of classes they use.</li>
      <li>I also plan on finding a Bootstrap and/or FontAwesome snippet extension for Atom.
        <li>
          I already have a working one on <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</abbr>, but Atom's Bootstrap extension seems to not be working correctly
        </li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <section class="rainbow">
      <h2>This is a new section!</h2>
      <p>Will this change to the file be recognized by GitHub's Desktop application?  I believe it will.  That means I don't even need to use Git itself, because GitHub integrates Git with itself and automatically enables commits.</p>
      <h2>Why is Atom not doing what I want it to do??</h2>
      <p>Sadly I'm gonna have to switch to <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSC</abbr> even though I'd rather use a fully open source text editor, and Atom is very stylish.</p>
      <p>Atom also makes it very easy to integrate with GitHub, since it's actually made by the same people who make GitHub.  Same company.</p>
      <p>So I recently added a few open source fonts to my windows installation.  Fonts that are not available right away.  I changed to Source Sans Pro.  I did have Roboto Mono active before, and actually that font I like better, but I'm just trying out other fonts.</p>
    </section>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Ok so I'm playing around here and I actually have HTML Preview active on Atom.  It automatically parses html output every time I stop typing!</h2>
      <p>This is amazing!  Why can't VSC have this sort of power?</p>
      <p>Now I just have to figure out how to make Atom easily do the same things VSC does.</p>

                That's good, I don't plan on having to buy themes when I'm learning about writing my own templates.  But there are multiple components involved in a theme like this.  I almost think it might have been better to use this them in a different way.  Possibly through <a href="http://stackbit.io">Stackbit</a></p>

                 <p class="text-muted">Since this theme is MIT licensed, you can use it commercially!</p>
                 <p class="lead text-primary">But you know what else is open source?  Github pages, Gatsby, and others that allow you to use <a href="http://markdownguide.com">Markdown</a> as the markup language.</p>

    <h2>So what's the big deal about Sublime Text?</h2>
    <p>I guess it's one of those text editors that are light and require some setting up</p>
    <p>It's a bit faster I think than VSCodium, but it's definitely not as feature packed out of the gate</p>
    <p>Microsoft knows what they're doing when it comes to nice text editors</p>
    <p class="new">Sublime does have some nice <b>Emmet</b> action going on, and when you type "&lt;/" it automatically closes the last open element.  Very nice to see.</p>
    <p>I actually kind of prefer that instead of the auto=-tag function where it automatically types the end tag out for you</p>
    <p>I mean, what if you want the end tag to be in a different location?  Say you want to <strong>Bolden</strong> up a word.</p>
    <p>In VSC and other code editors, you'll have to cut and paste the end tag because it types it out for you</p>
    <h2>Now I guess <b>Sublime Text</b> has <b>Git</b> integration, because after opening the folder, I see the name of the branch of the repository I'm currently editing</h2>
    <p>Super very super cool super</p>
