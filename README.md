# I have successfully templated and cloned the repository on my local computer.
**I have tried using the codesandbox.com trick by appending "box" in the git repo URL between "github" and ".com" and having it load into codesandbox.com, but it didn't work correctly**

I like to have everything synced to the cloud, right?  But right now I don't have my GitHub repositories automatically kept in sync with my Google Drive or OneDrive, partially because it's already kept track of by committing to Github.  But the way OneDrive works is much simpler.  If you don't necessarily need to keep track of commits and edits and such, OneDrive automatically syncs to the cloud without having to fill out commit messages.

#### This will create a codesandbox where you can use the online IDE based on Visual Studio Code.  It's not the exact same but it's close.


# [Start Bootstrap - New Age](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/new-age/)

[New Age](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/new-age/) is a web app landing page theme for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/).

## Preview

I'm using Visual Studio Code to edit as I've been having trouble with Atom, though Atom's a bit more *stylish* compared to VSC.

Atom has a simple HTML preview package available which I've tried and successfully used.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

* `gulp` the default task that builds everything
* `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
* `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
* `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
* `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm installed globally in order to use this build environment.
